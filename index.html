		<h1>Hello.</h1>
		<p>This is Enric Florit's personal homepage.</p>
		<p><i>(what do you think about that 90s opening sentence?)</i></p>
		<p>This was going to be a jekyll-powered, nicely designed website. But someone convinced me to handcraft it slowly on my own. Thus, in the following months this will grow back to what it used to be (quite a big blog about stuff I devote my time to), except it will be better and more up-to-date.</p>
		<p>Until then, I will give you a short list of places to go from here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The biggest and most serious project I've taken part in: <a href="https://skibeta.com">Skibeta</a></li>
			<li>My when-you-got-some-time, giving-back-to-the-community, have-fun-with-some-friends project: <a href="https://hackinglliure.org">Hacking Lliure</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/3nr1c">My github account</a></li>
			<li>My twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/enricflorit">@enricflorit</a> (don't expect many witty words, I retweet things most of the time)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I think this will be about it.</p>
