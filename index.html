		<h1>Hello.</h1>
		<p>This is Enric Florit's personal homepage.</p>
		<p><i>(what do you think about that 90s opening sentence?)</i></p>
		<p>Here you will find a growing (and at times, incomplete) list of my projects. In the <b>materials</b> section you'll find some slides for talks I have given. This website is updated once every few months, mostly when I have some new material to share.</p>
		<p>A short list of places to go from here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The biggest and most serious project I've taken part in: <a href="https://skibeta.com">Skibeta</a></li>
			<li>My when-you-got-some-time, giving-back-to-the-community, have-fun-with-some-friends project: <a href="https://hackinglliure.org">Hacking Lliure</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/3nr1c">My github account</a></li>
			<li>My twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/enricflorit">@enricflorit</a> (don't expect many witty words, I retweet things most of the time)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I think this will be about it for the introduction.</p>

		<h2>Materials</h2>

		<ul id="materials">
			<li><i>November 2019.</i> <b>Postquantum Cryptography: what, why, and how?</b>. Talk given at the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/index.html">SIMBa Seminar</a>. <i>Abstract</i>: The key agreement scheme proposed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 relies on the problem of finding discrete logarithms. One can choose appropriate groups where the best algorithms for solving thisproblem are too slow, such as certain elliptic curves over finite fields. There are already proposed quantum algorithms that breakdiscrete logarithms in polynomial time. For this reason multiple “postquantum” cryptography primitives have appeared in the lastyears, while trying to find harder computational problems. One of the proposed protocols using elliptic curves is SIDH/SIKE, candidate to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition. <a href="assets/Postquantum_Cryptography__what__why__and_how.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf).</a></li>

			<li><i>July 2019.</i> <b>Elliptic curves, Pairings, and the ECDLP</b>. I had the opportunity to attend to a Summer School named "Cryptography meets Graph Theory" (<a href="https://ifm.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/summerschool2019/">more info here</a>) where we were encouraged to present a poster. Mine was about the MOV attack, an algorithm that tries to simplify Discrete Logarithms over Elliptic Curves. You can find the poster <a href="/assets/ECDLP/ECDLP_poster.pdf">here</a>. I also wrote some <a href="/assets/ECDLP/ECDLP_notes.pdf">study notes</a>, although they are <i>very</i> incomplete. The material is fairly technical, but accessible once one has some basic knowledge on groups, arithmetic and elliptic curves.</li>

			<li><i>April 2019.</i> <b>p-adic attacks on elliptic curves</b>: the people at the <a href="http://overdriveconference.com">Overdrive Hacking Conference</a> asked me to do some talk on cryptograpy, and so I started studying about elliptic curve theory and ECC. During the actual talk I didn't have much time to explain the attack, but it is partially detailed in the slides. The main reference for study was Lawrence Washington's "Elliptic Curves: Number theory and Cryptography". <a href="/assets/p_adic_attacks_on_elliptic_curves.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf).</a></li>
