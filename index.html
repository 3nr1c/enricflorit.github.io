		<h1>Enric Florit Zacarías</h1>
		<p>I studied Mathematics and Computer Engineering at Universitat de Barcelona (2014 - 2020). I did my Master's degree in Advanced Mathematics at Universitat de Barcelona, which I finished in July 2021. During my master's degree I had support from a Màster+UB scholarship at IMUB. I started my PhD at UB in October 2021, funded by an FPU2020 grant from the Spanish Ministry of Universities.</p>
		
		<p>I am currently working on abelian varieties of GL(4)-type and their conjectural connection to Siegel paramodular forms.</p>

		<p>Here you will find a growing (and at times, incomplete) list of my projects. In the <b>materials</b> section you'll find some slides for talks I have given. This website is updated once every few months, mostly when I have some new material to share.</p>

			<li><i>May 2022.</i> <b>Let's twist again: the problem with fake abelian surfaces.</b> Talk given at the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/index.html">SIMBa Seminar</a>.</li>
			<p><i>Abstract</i>: The paramodularity conjecture of Brumer and Kramer proposes a connection between abelian surfaces and Siegel paramodular forms. In this correspondence there are some restrictions, for example, we ask that all the eigenvalues of a paramodular form are in Q. In theory, these forms could also correspond to fake surfaces, which are abelian fourfolds with quaternionic multiplication. This motivates the study of abelian varieties whose l-adic representations have dimension 4, which is the case of abelian surfaces. 	 	
			<br>
			In this talk, I will explain the objects in the paramodularity conjecture: my goal is to put emphasis in the classification of abelian varieties of GL(4)-type, and in particular the ones that have similar representations to those of abelian surfaces. I will also present the examples we currently have at our disposal. Finally I will explain the difficulty in working with fake surfaces.

			<p>Abstract: 
			We survey several aspects of supersingular elliptic curves and their isogeny graphs. Isogeny graphs have obtained attention for the last fifteen years due to their uses in quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols. Studying them involves looking at elliptic curves, quaternion algebras, and random walks on (almost) regular graphs, among other topics. In particular, we give the tools necessary to state the Ramanujan property, connecting supersingular curves in characteristic p with modular forms of level p. We also explain the hash function of Charles, Lauter and Goren as an example of application.</p>

			<li><i>July 2021.</i> <b>Abelian surfaces, Siegel modular forms, and the Paramodularity Conjecture</b>. Master's Thesis.
			<p>I studied abelian varieties and their associated representations and L-functions, in order to connect them to modular forms. The construction of Eichler and Shimura is treated and the statement of modularity for elliptic curves and GL(2)-type abelian varieties is given. Then I moved on to studying Siegel paramodular forms and stated the paramodularity conjecture for abelian surfaces with trivial endomorphism ring. The code written to check the first known case of the conjecture has lots of room for improvement, and I want to rewrite it in the following months to improve efficiency (and possibly allow for a full check of paramodularity in level 277). <a href="/assets/TFM/Memoria--TFM--Enric-Florit.pdf">The document can be found here</a>, you can also see my <a href="/assets/TFM/Beamer--TFM--Enric-Florit.pdf">slides</a>.</p></li>

			<li><i>June 2020.</i> <b>Superspecial isogeny graphs in genus 2</b>. Talk given at the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/index.html">SIMBa Seminar</a>.
			<p><i>Abstract</i>: Supersingular isogeny graphs allow us to formulate supposedly post-quantum protocols, based on the fact that we don't have efficient algorithms to find isogenies between curves. These graphs are expanders and Ramanujan; in particular, the stationary distribution of the random walk is (essentially) uniform. After defining these notions, we will talk about the generalization of these graphs with hyperelliptic genus 2 curves, and we will explain some properties appearing in this case and the differences with elliptic curve graphs. <a href="assets/Superspecial_isogeny_graphs_in_genus_2.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf)</a>.</p></li>

			<p><i>Abstract</i>: The SIDH protocol was presented in 2011 by Jao and De Feo, giving an alternative to the key exchange of Diffie-Hellman which is resistent to quantum cryptanalysis. Its security is based in the difficulty of finding isogenies between two supersingular elliptic curves. The main concept used is quotienting a curve by a finite subgroup, so that private keys are cyclic subgroups of a certain initial curve, and public keys are the respective quotient curves. These are computed with the Vélu formulas, although the computation of high-degree isogenies must be optimized to make the protocol effective. After explaining the protocol and justifying the choice of parameters, we will see two attacks with which we can try to break keys. <a href="assets/STNB2020-EnricFlorit-handout.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf)</a>.</p></li>

			<li><i>November 2019.</i> <b>Postquantum Cryptography: what, why, and how?</b> Talk given at the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/simba/en/index.html">SIMBa Seminar</a>.
			<p><i>Abstract</i>: The key agreement scheme proposed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 relies on the problem of finding discrete logarithms. One can choose appropriate groups where the best algorithms for solving this problem are too slow, such as certain elliptic curves over finite fields. There are already proposed quantum algorithms that break discrete logarithms in polynomial time. For this reason multiple "postquantum" cryptography primitives have appeared in the last years, while trying to find harder computational problems. One of the proposed protocols using elliptic curves is SIDH/SIKE, candidate to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition. <a href="assets/Postquantum_Cryptography__what__why__and_how.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf)</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/VA30KI5cG8c">recording of the talk here</a>.</p></li>

			<li><i>July 2019.</i> <b>Elliptic curves, Pairings, and the ECDLP</b>.
			<p>I had the opportunity to attend to a Summer School named "Cryptography meets Graph Theory" (<a href="https://ifm.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/summerschool2019/">more info here</a>) where we were encouraged to present a poster. Mine was about the MOV attack, an algorithm that tries to simplify Discrete Logarithms over Elliptic Curves. You can find the poster <a href="/assets/ECDLP/ECDLP_poster.pdf">here</a>. I also wrote some <a href="/assets/ECDLP/ECDLP_notes.pdf">study notes</a>, although they are <i>very</i> incomplete. The material is fairly technical, but accessible once one has some basic knowledge on groups, arithmetic and elliptic curves.</p></li>

			<li><i>April 2019.</i> <b>p-adic attacks on elliptic curves</b>.
			<p>The people at the Overdrive Hacking Conference asked me to do some talk on cryptograpy, and so I started studying about elliptic curve theory and ECC. During the actual talk I didn't have much time to explain the attack, but it is partially detailed in the slides. The main reference for study was Lawrence Washington's "Elliptic Curves: Number theory and Cryptography". <a href="/assets/p_adic_attacks_on_elliptic_curves.pdf">You can find the slides here (pdf).</a></p></li>
